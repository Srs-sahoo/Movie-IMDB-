Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

is slightli less good than than rotj sinc it wa slower move wa not as episod and i just did not feel as much suspens or emot as i did with the third movi br br it also seem like to me that after read these surpris review that the reason peopl cite for rotj be an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicr and are insignific reason compar to the sheer excel of the film as a whole i have heard mani strang reason such as a becaus yoda die b becaus bobba fett die c becaus small ewok defeat a band of stormtroop d becaus darth vader wa reveal br br i would like to debunk each of these reason becaus i believ that they miss the point complet first off who care if bobba fett die if georg luca want him to die then he want him to die don t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appear and it wa not luca intent to make him a central charact in the film that star war fan made him out to be hi name wa not even mention anywher in the movi you had to go to the credit to find out bobba fett s name judg rotj becaus a minor charact die is a bit much i think secondli mani fan did not like yoda die sure it wa a moment period in the movi i wa not happi to see him die either but it make the movi more realist all the good guy can t stay aliv in a realist movi you know otherwis if all the good guy live and all the bad guy die thi movi would have been tantamount to a cheesi saturday morn cartoon anoth aspect to thi point about peopl not like yoda s death well nobodi complain when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope mani consid a new hope to be the best of the trilog whi wa obi wan s death okay but yoda s not hmmmmmmmmmmmm anoth reason i just can not believ wa even state wa becaus peopl found cute ewok overpow stormtroop to be imposs that is utterli ridicul i can not believ thi one first off the ewok are in their nativ planet endor so they are cogniz of their home terrain sinc they live there if you watch the movi care mani of the tactic the ewok use in defeat the stormtroop wa through excel use of their home field advantag sinc you live in the forest all your life i hope you would have learn to use it to your advantag they had swing vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroop were highli disadvantag becaus they were outnumb and not awar of the advantag of the forest the onli thing they had wa their blaster to add it wa not like the ewok were battl the stormtroop themselv they were heavili assist by the band of rebel in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroop were to have defeat a combin of the star war hero the band of rebel as well as the huge clan of ewok with great familiar of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastli if thi scene wa still unbeliev to you how about in empir strike back or in a new hope where there were sever scene of a group consist of just han solo chewbacca and the princess be shot at by like ten stormtroop and all their blaster miss while the hero were in full view and not onli that the hero of cours alway hit the stormtroop with their blaster the trooper must have veri veri bad aim then at least in empir strike back the battl of endor wa much more believ sinc you had two armi pit each other not hero against a legion of stormtroop don t believ me check out the battl at cloud citi when our hero were escap lando s base or when our hero were rescu princess leia and be shot at somehow they miss as han solo and luke were tri to exit the death star br br the last reason that i care to discuss other are just too plain ridicul for me to spend my time here is that peopl did not like darth vader be reveal well in mani way that wa a major part of the plot in the movi luke wa tri to find whether or not darth vader wa hi father annakin skywalk it would have been disappoint if the movi had end without luke get to see hi father s face becaus it made it complet by annakin s revel it symbol the transit darth vader underw from be possess by the dark side in hi helmet and to the good person he wa annakin skywalk by remov the helmet the point is that annakin die convert to the light side again and that is what the mean of the helmet remov scene wa about in fact that s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke s father isn t that what you would have done if you want to see your son with your own eye befor you die and not in a mechan helmet br br on anoth note i think a subconsci or consciou expect among most peopl is that the sequel must be wors even if it is better that preced movi is anoth reason that rotj doe not get as mani accolad as it deserv i never go into a film with that decept in mind i alway tri to go into a film with the attitud that well it might be better or wors that the origin
